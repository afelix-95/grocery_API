# grocery_API
 An API that handles HTTP requests for a supermarket. It can be used, for example, by any delivery app that wants to offer this supermarket's products as part of its deliverables.
## Instructions
This application defines the API endpoint `/products` to manage the list of products available in the supermarket. It handles requests for all the CRUD operations.
You can try out this application by installing `flask` with `pip`:
```
python -m pip install flask
```
To run this Flask application, you first need to set an environment variable called `FLASK_APP` to `app.py`. This tells Flask which file contains your application.
Run the following command inside the folder that contains app.py:
```
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
If you're using macOS or Linux you need to use `export` instead of `set`.
With the environment variable ready, you can now start the Flask development server by calling `flask run`.
